# Pipex
This project will let you discover in detail a UNIX mechanism that you already know by using it in your program


The time has finally come to delve into the intricacies of UNIX. It's amusing how one of my most cherished discoveries during Libft at Rank 1 was about file descriptors. I still recall the struggles I faced during testing...

Nah, I couldn't confine myself to the basics of sending output to STDOUT. I wanted to see it in action, to create archives, append data, and more.

Yeah, it was truly worth it! I suppose now that we need to know how to do it, having experienced my own struggles before, understanding the concepts of pipes for Pipex comes more easily.
